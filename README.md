# Permaweb Cookbook

The Permaweb Cookbook is meant to house small digestible code snippets
for someone that has no experience with blockchain or Permaweb to be able
to grab and go. 

## Contributing

The Cookbook is welcome to any and all contributions. Please refer to
the project's style when contributing new snippets of code.

### Structure

Currently we have "topics" under `/docs` and the code for those topics.

### References

References are an overarching topic with a list of references of how to do
things under that topic. The general structure is the following:

```
Code Reference Title

Short Summary

Code Snippet
```

### Guides

Guides are longer form informational documentation on various topics.
The general structure for writing a guide is the following:

```
Brief Summary/TL;DR

Fact Sheet

Deep Dive

Other Resources
```

### Building

You need to have node v16 installed - https://nodejs.org

```sh
cd docs
yarn
